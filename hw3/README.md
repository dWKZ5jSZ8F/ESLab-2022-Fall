# HW3: BLE Central Programming

## Description
In this project, we practice device connection via BLE protocol using **Linux PC** (host) and the interface of a **Raspberry Pi 3 microcontroller** (target system). The BLE connection is examined through **BLE Tool** application acting as the peripheral device.

## Requirements
**Development Environment:** 
Linux PC (Host), Raspberry Pi 3 or above (target system), any peripheral device.
Bootable Raspberry OS. Use `minicom` or any terminal to connect via USB-TTL.

## How to run
1. Connect RPi3 to Linux host and log in.
2. Run `ble_scan_connect.py`.
3. Connect to any BLE peripheral device using particular device UUIDs.
