# HW5: PWM and Logic Analyzer
## Description
In this homework, we use the B-L4S5I-IOT01A development board and PwmOut() API from Mbed OS to form pulse-width-modulated waveforms, then proceed to make observations with the Zeroplus Logic Cube logic analyzer. Furthermore, I added button service for switching the signal frequency. 

## How to run 
1. Import files from Github repo `mbed-os-snippet-PwmOut_ex_3` (url: https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-snippet-PwmOut_ex_3) into Mbed Studio.
2. Replace `~\main.cpp` file.
4. Build and compile the program.
